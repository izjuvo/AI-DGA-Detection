# Project Summary

This project implements an AI-driven system to classify domain names as either benign or DGA-generated. Using statistical features (domain length, Shannon entropy), sparse textual features (TF-IDF character n-grams), and deep sequential features (character-level BiLSTM), three independent models are trained and then combined using a logistic stacking meta-classifier. Experiments show that the SVM (using TF-IDF) achieves the strongest individual performance (~89% accuracy), and the stacking ensemble achieves a similar overall performance. This work demonstrates that heterogeneous feature spaces and lightweight models can be combined to deliver strong DGA detection results on a domain-only basis, forming a practical baseline for real-time DNS security applications.
